This repository holds all the 50 projects that I followed from the 50 Projects in 50 Days udemy course. It does not represent my own code, just the skills I have learning during the course.

The function of this repository is merely educacional. I am practicing on doing html, css, and vanilla javascript projects and using git/github.
